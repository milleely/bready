### Changes Made

**API Route Fix (`app/api/networth/expense-breakdown/route.ts`):**

- Lines 38-68: Split query into two parts:
  1. User's expenses (personal 100% + shared ÷ userCount)
  2. Other household members' SHARED expenses (÷ userCount)
- Lines 75-115: Updated calculation logic to sum both parts correctly
- **Before**: Only counted authenticated user's expenses

**UI Alignment Fixes:**

- **Household-Aware Calculations**: Shared expenses divided by household member count
- **Security**: PIN-based authentication for personal financial data
- **Session Management**: Client-side session storage for auth state
