## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` for new features (e.g., `feature/csv-export`)
- `fix/` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/budget-calculation`)
- `docs/` for documentation (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `refactor/` for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/expense-service`)

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow our [style guidelines](#style-guidelines)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the dev server and test manually
npm run dev

# Run type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Test the build
npm run build
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our [commit message convention](#commit-message-convention):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add CSV export functionality"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub!

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use strict mode

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props

```typescript
interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string
  onSubmit: () => void
}

export function MyComponent({ title, onSubmit }: MyComponentProps) {
  // Component logic
}
```

### File Organization

- Place components in `components/` directory
- Place API routes in `app/api/` directory
- Place utilities in `lib/` directory
- Group related files together

### Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Max line length: 100 characters

---

## Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
# New feature
git commit -m "feat: add CSV export functionality"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: correct budget calculation for shared expenses"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: redesign API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: API now returns data in different structure"
```

   ```

2. **Update `prisma/seed.ts`** if needed
3. **Document the changes** in your PR description
4. **Test the migration** on a fresh database
