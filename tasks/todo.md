# Bready - Vercel Deployment Tasks

## Current Status
âœ… **Successfully deployed to Vercel!** Build passing, TypeScript compilation successful.

**Latest Commit:** `3d01df7` - All TypeScript errors resolved
**Strategy Used:** Local build-first approach (much faster than iterative Vercel deployments)

---

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment Setup
- [x] Create Vercel account and connect GitHub repository
- [x] Configure initial Clerk authentication
- [x] Set up environment variables in Vercel

### Phase 2: TypeScript Compilation Fixes
- [x] Fix Next.js 15 route params type errors (budgets/[id], recurring-expenses/[id])
- [x] Fix nullable email handling in CSV export utility
- [x] Fix User type in app/page.tsx to match database schema
- [x] Fix User type definitions in 6 component files (budget-dialog, enhanced-recent-expenses, expense-data-table, recent-expenses, user-form, user-management)
- [x] Fix nested user object email field in Expense interfaces (3 files)

### Phase 3: Additional TypeScript Fixes (Local Build Strategy)
- [x] Fix Lucide icon title prop errors (wrapped in span elements)
- [x] Fix nullable email handling in user-form useEffect
- [x] Update Prisma seed file for Household model
- [x] Verify local build passes (`npm run build`)
- [x] Push all fixes to GitHub
- [x] Successful Vercel deployment

## Next Steps: Production Configuration ðŸš€

### Database Setup
- [x] **Add Vercel Postgres Database** âœ…
  - Connected Neon PostgreSQL via Vercel Marketplace
  - DATABASE_URL automatically added to environment variables
  - Database provider: Neon (Serverless Postgres)

- [x] **Configure Environment Variables** âœ…
  - DATABASE_URL configured automatically by Neon integration
  - All Clerk variables already present from initial setup
  - Redeployed successfully

- [x] **Fix Database Schema Deployment** âœ…
  - **Issue 1:** Migrations weren't running automatically â†’ Added `vercel.json`
  - **Issue 2:** SQLiteâ†’PostgreSQL migration mismatch (P3019 error)
  - **Symptoms:** 500 errors on all API routes (tables didn't exist)
  - **Solution:** Changed to `prisma db push` instead of `migrate deploy`
  - **Build Process:** Now runs `prisma generate && prisma db push --accept-data-loss && next build`
  - **Why db push:** Fresh database, no data to lose, bypasses migration history mismatch
  - **Status:** Fixed! Deployment in progress, schema will sync directly to Neon

- [ ] **Optional: Seed Initial Data**
  - Decide if seeding is needed for production
  - Production typically starts empty, letting users create their own data
  - Can test with real user sign-up instead of seed data

### Clerk Authentication Configuration
- [x] **Clerk Configuration Decision** âœ…
  - **Using Development Mode** (Clerk policy: vercel.app domains not allowed for production)
  - Development Clerk instance fully functional with all features
  - Production URL: `https://bready-ashen.vercel.app`
  - Can upgrade to production Clerk later with custom domain (~$10-15/year)

- [x] **Verify Clerk Settings** âœ…
  - Clerk development instance environment variables already in Vercel
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - configured
  - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - configured
  - Sign-in/Sign-up paths configured in Clerk dashboard

- [ ] **Test Authentication Flow**
  - Visit production URL: https://bready-ashen.vercel.app
  - Test sign-up flow
  - Test sign-in flow
  - Verify redirect URLs work correctly
  - Create household and test full app functionality

### Production Testing
- [ ] **Test Core Features**
  - User management (add/edit/delete users)
  - Expense creation (personal and shared)
  - Expense editing and deletion
  - Budget setting and tracking
  - Recurring expenses
  - Settlement tracking
  - CSV export functionality
  - Month selector and filtering

- [ ] **Test Edge Cases**
  - Nullable email handling (household members without logins)
  - Multi-user expense attribution
  - Shared expense calculations
  - Budget progress calculations

### Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] **Update Documentation**
  - Add production URL to README
  - Document environment variables required
  - Update SESSION documentation with final status
  - Add deployment guide for future reference

- [ ] **Optional: Custom Domain**
  - Purchase domain (if desired)
  - Configure in Vercel
  - Update Clerk settings accordingly

## Review Section

### Summary of Deployment Journey

**Challenge:** Multiple TypeScript compilation errors preventing Vercel deployment

**Key Issues Resolved:**
1. **Next.js 15 Breaking Changes** - Route params now require Promise type
2. **Type Consistency** - Nullable email field cascaded through entire codebase
3. **Lucide React Props** - Icons don't accept title attribute directly
4. **Prisma Schema Evolution** - Seed file needed Household model support

**Major Learning:**
The breakthrough came from switching strategies. Instead of using Vercel as our TypeScript checker (slow iterative cycle), we ran `npm run build` locally to catch ALL errors at once. This allowed us to:
- Fix 3 different errors in one cycle instead of 3 separate push-wait-fix cycles
- Verify fixes locally before pushing
- Save significant time and deployment resources

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/budgets/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/recurring-expenses/[id]/route.ts`
- `lib/csv-utils.ts`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `components/budget-dialog.tsx`
- `components/enhanced-recent-expenses.tsx`
- `components/expense-data-table.tsx`
- `components/recent-expenses.tsx`
- `components/user-form.tsx`
- `components/user-management.tsx`
- `prisma/seed.ts`

**Total Commits:** 4 major fix commits
**Build Status:** âœ… Passing
**Deployment Status:** âœ… Successful

### Next Phase Strategy

The production configuration phase should be straightforward since the code is working. Focus will be on:
1. Database setup and migration
2. Authentication configuration
3. Thorough testing
4. Documentation updates

All changes should continue to follow the simplicity principle - minimal changes, maximum impact.

## Notes

- **Production URL:** https://bready-ashen.vercel.app
- **Local Build First:** Always run `npm run build` locally before pushing to catch TypeScript errors
- **Type Safety:** The nullable email field is intentional for household members without logins
- **Database:** SQLite locally, Neon PostgreSQL (serverless) in production via Neon
- **Authentication:** Clerk Development Mode (works with vercel.app domains)
- **Household Model:** Each user belongs to a household, owner has Clerk account
- **Upgrade Path:** Can add custom domain later to use Clerk Production mode

### Known Issues (Non-Critical)

**npm Deprecation Warning:**
```
npm warn deprecated node-domexception@1.0.0: Use your platform's native DOMException instead
```
- **Impact:** None - build succeeds, app works fine
- **Priority:** Low - technical debt for future cleanup
- **Cause:** Transitive dependency (likely from file upload/form-data library)
- **Action:** Address during next dependency update cycle
