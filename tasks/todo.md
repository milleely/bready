# Bready - Vercel Deployment Tasks

## Current Status
âœ… **Successfully deployed to Vercel!** Build passing, TypeScript compilation successful.

**Latest Commit:** `3d01df7` - All TypeScript errors resolved
**Strategy Used:** Local build-first approach (much faster than iterative Vercel deployments)

---

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment Setup
- [x] Create Vercel account and connect GitHub repository
- [x] Configure initial Clerk authentication
- [x] Set up environment variables in Vercel

### Phase 2: TypeScript Compilation Fixes
- [x] Fix Next.js 15 route params type errors (budgets/[id], recurring-expenses/[id])
- [x] Fix nullable email handling in CSV export utility
- [x] Fix User type in app/page.tsx to match database schema
- [x] Fix User type definitions in 6 component files (budget-dialog, enhanced-recent-expenses, expense-data-table, recent-expenses, user-form, user-management)
- [x] Fix nested user object email field in Expense interfaces (3 files)

### Phase 3: Additional TypeScript Fixes (Local Build Strategy)
- [x] Fix Lucide icon title prop errors (wrapped in span elements)
- [x] Fix nullable email handling in user-form useEffect
- [x] Update Prisma seed file for Household model
- [x] Verify local build passes (`npm run build`)
- [x] Push all fixes to GitHub
- [x] Successful Vercel deployment

## Next Steps: Production Configuration ðŸš€

### Database Setup
- [ ] **Add Vercel Postgres Database**
  - Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Storage â†’ Create Database
  - Select PostgreSQL
  - Name: `bready-db` (or similar)
  - Copy the DATABASE_URL connection string

- [ ] **Configure Environment Variables**
  - Add `DATABASE_URL` to Vercel environment variables
  - Verify all Clerk variables are present:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
  - Redeploy to apply environment variables

- [ ] **Run Database Migrations**
  - Option A: Let Vercel build run migrations automatically
  - Option B: Run manually via Vercel CLI or dashboard
  - Verify all tables created (User, Household, Expense, Budget, RecurringExpense, Settlement)

- [ ] **Optional: Seed Initial Data**
  - Decide if seeding is needed for production
  - Run seed script if necessary (with updated household logic)

### Clerk Authentication Configuration
- [ ] **Update Clerk Domain Settings**
  - Get actual Vercel production URL (e.g., `bready.vercel.app`)
  - Go to Clerk Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
  - Replace `bready.com` with actual Vercel URL
  - Add both HTTP and HTTPS if needed

- [ ] **Test Authentication Flow**
  - Visit production URL
  - Test sign-up flow
  - Test sign-in flow
  - Verify redirect URLs work correctly

### Production Testing
- [ ] **Test Core Features**
  - User management (add/edit/delete users)
  - Expense creation (personal and shared)
  - Expense editing and deletion
  - Budget setting and tracking
  - Recurring expenses
  - Settlement tracking
  - CSV export functionality
  - Month selector and filtering

- [ ] **Test Edge Cases**
  - Nullable email handling (household members without logins)
  - Multi-user expense attribution
  - Shared expense calculations
  - Budget progress calculations

### Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] **Update Documentation**
  - Add production URL to README
  - Document environment variables required
  - Update SESSION documentation with final status
  - Add deployment guide for future reference

- [ ] **Optional: Custom Domain**
  - Purchase domain (if desired)
  - Configure in Vercel
  - Update Clerk settings accordingly

## Review Section

### Summary of Deployment Journey

**Challenge:** Multiple TypeScript compilation errors preventing Vercel deployment

**Key Issues Resolved:**
1. **Next.js 15 Breaking Changes** - Route params now require Promise type
2. **Type Consistency** - Nullable email field cascaded through entire codebase
3. **Lucide React Props** - Icons don't accept title attribute directly
4. **Prisma Schema Evolution** - Seed file needed Household model support

**Major Learning:**
The breakthrough came from switching strategies. Instead of using Vercel as our TypeScript checker (slow iterative cycle), we ran `npm run build` locally to catch ALL errors at once. This allowed us to:
- Fix 3 different errors in one cycle instead of 3 separate push-wait-fix cycles
- Verify fixes locally before pushing
- Save significant time and deployment resources

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/budgets/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/recurring-expenses/[id]/route.ts`
- `lib/csv-utils.ts`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `components/budget-dialog.tsx`
- `components/enhanced-recent-expenses.tsx`
- `components/expense-data-table.tsx`
- `components/recent-expenses.tsx`
- `components/user-form.tsx`
- `components/user-management.tsx`
- `prisma/seed.ts`

**Total Commits:** 4 major fix commits
**Build Status:** âœ… Passing
**Deployment Status:** âœ… Successful

### Next Phase Strategy

The production configuration phase should be straightforward since the code is working. Focus will be on:
1. Database setup and migration
2. Authentication configuration
3. Thorough testing
4. Documentation updates

All changes should continue to follow the simplicity principle - minimal changes, maximum impact.

## Notes

- **Local Build First:** Always run `npm run build` locally before pushing to catch TypeScript errors
- **Type Safety:** The nullable email field is intentional for household members without logins
- **Database:** Currently using SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in production
- **Authentication:** Clerk handles all auth, one owner per household
- **Household Model:** Each user belongs to a household, owner has Clerk account

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** Ready for production configuration
**Next Task:** Add Vercel Postgres database
