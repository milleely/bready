## Completed Features

### ✅ Phase 1: Budget & Goals System (5/5 tasks)

**Database:**
- Added `Budget` model to Prisma schema with unique constraint on (category, month, userId)
- Migration: `20251009213512_add_budget_model`

**API Routes:**
- `GET/POST /api/budgets` - List budgets with month/userId filtering, create new budgets
- `PUT/DELETE /api/budgets/[id]` - Update and delete budgets
- Conflict handling for duplicate budgets (same category + month + user)

**UI Components:**
- `BudgetDialog` - Form to set monthly budgets per category (shared or per-user)
  - Amber-themed styling consistent with app design
  - Validates category, amount, and month
  - Purple-to-blue gradient button
- `BudgetProgress` - Visual progress bars showing budget vs actual spending
  - Color-coded: green (on track), yellow (>80%), red (over budget)
  - Only displays when budgets exist for current month

**Key Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Budget model
- `app/api/budgets/route.ts` - List and create
- `app/api/budgets/[id]/route.ts` - Update and delete
- `components/budget-dialog.tsx` - Budget creation dialog
- `components/budget-progress.tsx` - Progress visualization

**Git Commit:** `5110dc3` - feat: add budget tracking system with progress visualization

---

### ✅ Month Selector Feature (4/4 tasks)

**Component:**
- `MonthSelector` - Navigation with prev/next buttons and "Today" quick jump
  - Displays current month in "October 2025" format
  - Calendar icon with amber border styling
  - Amber gradient "Today" button

**State Management:**
- Added `selectedMonth` state to main page (defaults to current month)
- useEffect dependency on `selectedMonth` triggers automatic data refetch

**Dynamic Data Fetching:**
- All API calls now filtered by selected month
- Calculates start date (1st of month) and end date (last day of month)
- Passes `startDate` and `endDate` to `/api/expenses` and `/api/stats`
- Passes month string (YYYY-MM) to `/api/budgets`

**UI Integration:**
- Positioned in header between title and action buttons
- All metrics cards, budget progress, charts, and expense list dynamically filter by month

**Impact:** Complete time-based filtering across entire dashboard

**Key Files:**
- `components/month-selector.tsx` - Month navigation component
- `app/page.tsx` - State management and API integration

**Git Commit:** `b3e726c` - feat: add month selector for dynamic data filtering

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Recurring Expenses System (4/4 tasks)

**Database:**
- Added `RecurringExpense` model to Prisma schema
  - Fields: amount, category, description, frequency, dayOfMonth, dayOfWeek, monthOfYear
  - `nextDate` field tracks when to create next expense
  - `isActive` flag to enable/disable recurring patterns
  - Supports monthly, weekly, yearly frequencies
- Added `recurringExpenseId` field to Expense model (optional foreign key)
- Bidirectional relation between Expense and RecurringExpense
- Migrations:
  - `20251009221425_add_recurring_expense` - RecurringExpense model
  - `20251010000349_add_recurring_expense_relation` - Expense linkage

- `POST /api/recurring-expenses/generate` - Auto-generation endpoint
  - Checks for due recurring expenses (nextDate <= now)
  - Creates actual expenses
  - Updates nextDate to next occurrence

**Auto-Generation Logic:**
- Integrated into main page `fetchData` function
- Runs on every page load before fetching data
- Automatically creates expenses when recurring patterns are due
- Advances nextDate based on frequency:
  - Monthly: +1 month on specified day
  - Weekly: +7 days
  - Yearly: +1 year on specified month/day

**UI Components:**
- `RecurringExpenseDialog` - Management dialog for recurring expenses
  - Dynamic form fields based on frequency selection
  - Weekly: Shows day of week selector
  - Monthly: Shows day of month input
  - Yearly: Shows month selector + day of month
  - Green-to-teal gradient button
  - Checkbox for shared expenses

**Visual Indicators:**

### ✅ UI Improvements (2/2 tasks)

**Export CSV Relocation:**
- Moved Export CSV button from header to Recent Expenses card header
- Better contextual grouping (export button where data lives)
- Updated `RecentExpenses` component to accept `users` prop
- Updated `ExportDialog` integration

**Gradient Button Redesign:**
- **Set Budget:** Purple-to-blue gradient (`from-purple-600 to-blue-600`)
- **Add Recurring:** Green-to-teal gradient (`from-green-600 to-teal-600`)
- **Add Expense:** Amber-to-orange gradient (`from-amber-600 to-orange-600`)
- All buttons: consistent styling (gradient background, white text, font-semibold, shadow-lg)

- Amount/arrow now properly centered considering button width
- Glassmorphic card styling with `bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm`
- Emerald "Mark as Paid" button with hover states
- User avatars positioned at edges with info text between

- Updated cards to match Settlement glassmorphic styling
- Changed to ghost buttons for edit/delete actions
- Contextual hover colors: amber for edit, red for delete
- Buttons repositioned to right side for cleaner layout
- Avatar styling updated with consistent shadows

**Table Improvements (Recent Expenses):**
- Fixed column header alignment using zero-padding button pattern (`p-0`)
- All headers now sortable with consistent `ArrowUpDown` icons
- Updated badge colors for consistency:
  - Personal: `bg-amber-600` (matches Spending Per Person)
  - Shared: `bg-emerald-600` (matches Spending Per Person)
- Simplified actions menu (removed "Copy expense ID")
- All column titles properly aligned with cell content

**Month Selector Refinements:**

### ✅ Hero Card Polish & Page Reorganization (2025-10-15)

**Hero Card Improvements:**
- **Fixed trend text wrapping issue**
  - Added `whitespace-nowrap` CSS class to prevent "(+0% vs last mo)" from breaking to two lines
  - Location: `app/(new-layout)/dashboard/page.tsx` line 327
  - User experience: Cleaner, more professional single-line display

- **Replaced emoji indicators with professional Lucide icons**
  - Budget Health badge now uses contextual icons instead of emoji circles
  - Healthy (on track): `CheckCircle2` with green-500 background
  - Warning (>80%): `AlertCircle` with amber-400 background
  - Over budget: `AlertTriangle` with red-500 background
  - No budgets set: `CircleDashed` with gray-400 background
  - Enhanced styling: rounded-2xl, backdrop-blur, shadow effects
  - Location: `app/(new-layout)/dashboard/page.tsx` lines 351-376

- **Added bread-themed emoji bullets**
  - 🥖 (baguette) for shared expenses (communal bread)
  - 🍞 (bread slice) for personal expenses (individual portions)
  - Location: `app/(new-layout)/dashboard/page.tsx` lines 337, 341
  - Design rationale: Reinforces Bready's bread-based brand identity

**Page Reorganization: Insights → Expenses**
- **Consolidated expense analytics with transaction data**
  - Moved `EnhancedSpendingCharts` component from Insights page to Expenses page
  - Rationale: Users expect visualizations near the data they represent (information scent)
  - Reduces context switching between pages

- **Implemented collapsible "Spending Analytics" section**
  - Installed shadcn collapsible component (`npx shadcn@latest add @shadcn/collapsible`)
  - Shows/hides category pie chart and per-person spending bar chart
  - Show/Hide toggle button with ChevronUp/ChevronDown icons
  - Amber gradient styling (`from-amber-50/50 to-orange-50/50`) matching brand theme
  - Location: `app/(new-layout)/expenses/page.tsx` lines 197-232

- **localStorage persistence for user preference**
  - Key: `expenses-analytics-open`
  - Defaults to expanded on first visit (most users want analytics)
  - Remembers collapsed/expanded state across sessions
  - SSR-safe with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` check
  - Location: `app/(new-layout)/expenses/page.tsx` lines 60-67, 123-128

- **Added stats API integration to Expenses page**
  - Parallel fetch with `Promise.all` for optimal performance
  - Fetches category breakdown and per-person spending data
  - Location: `app/(new-layout)/expenses/page.tsx` lines 97-111

- **Cleaned up Insights page**
  - Removed `EnhancedSpendingCharts` component import and usage
  - Removed "Top Spending Category" summary card
  - Removed "Shared vs Personal" summary card
  - Removed stats API call and state management
  - Page now contains only AI Financial Insights placeholder card
  - Reserved exclusively for future AI-powered features
  - Location: `app/(new-layout)/insights/page.tsx` (entire file simplified)

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/(new-layout)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Hero card icon system, text wrapping fix, bread emojis
  - `app/(new-layout)/expenses/page.tsx` - Added collapsible analytics section with stats integration
  - `app/(new-layout)/insights/page.tsx` - Removed charts and summary cards
  - `components/ui/collapsible.tsx` - New shadcn component (Radix UI primitive)
  - `package.json` and `package-lock.json` - Added @radix-ui/react-collapsible dependency

- **Design Patterns Used:**
  - Progressive disclosure: Secondary content hidden in collapsible sections
  - Information architecture: Related content grouped together (analytics + expenses)
  - Conditional rendering: Different icons based on budget health status
  - State persistence: localStorage for UI preferences

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Collapsible component only renders content when expanded
  - Single API call fetches all stats data (no additional latency)
  - Parallel Promise.all for multiple independent API calls

**User Experience Impact:**
- 3-second rule maintained: Dashboard still answers "Am I okay?" quickly
- Reduced navigation friction: Expense analytics now one click away from expense list
- Professional appearance: Icons replace emoji for better visual hierarchy
- Persistent preferences: User's analytics collapsed/expanded choice remembered

**Documentation Updated:**
- `todo.md` - Added "Hero Card Final Polish" completion notes (lines 277-292)
- `todo.md` - Added "Page Reorganization: Insights & Expenses" completion notes (lines 294-324)
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` - This section (comprehensive session documentation)

**Git Commit:** `[Next]` - feat: improve dashboard hero card and reorganize insights/expenses pages
