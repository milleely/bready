Bready is a multi-user expense tracking app built with Next.js 15, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS v4. This document tracks the implementation progress of new features beyond the initial multi-user expense tracker.

## Completed Features (11/29 tasks)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Budget & Goals System (5 tasks)

- **Database Migration** - `20251009213512_add_budget_model`
- **API Routes** - Full CRUD at `/api/budgets` and `/api/budgets/[id]`
  - GET with month and userId filtering
  - POST with conflict handling for duplicate budgets
  - PUT and DELETE operations
- **BudgetDialog Component** - Form to set monthly budgets per category (shared or per-user)
  - Uses amber styling consistent with app theme
  - Validates category, amount, and month
- **BudgetProgress Component** - Visual progress bars showing budget vs spending
  - Color-coded: green (on track), yellow (>80%), red (over budget)
  - Only displays when budgets exist

**Key Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Budget model
- `app/api/budgets/route.ts` - List and create
- `app/api/budgets/[id]/route.ts` - Update and delete
- `components/budget-dialog.tsx` - Budget creation dialog

- **Dynamic Data Fetching** - All API calls now filtered by selected month
  - Calculates start date (1st of month) and end date (last day of month)
  - Passes `startDate` and `endDate` to `/api/expenses` and `/api/stats`
  - Passes month to `/api/budgets`

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes
```prisma
// Budget model
model Budget {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  category  String
  amount    Float
  month     String   // Format: "YYYY-MM"
  userId    String?  // null = shared budget
  @@unique([category, month, userId])
}

// RecurringExpense model
model RecurringExpense {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  amount      Float
  category    String
  description String
  frequency   String   // "monthly", "weekly", "yearly"
  dayOfMonth  Int?     // 1-31
  dayOfWeek   Int?     // 0-6 (0=Sunday)
  monthOfYear Int?     // 1-12
  isShared    Boolean  @default(false)
  userId      String
  nextDate    DateTime
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
}
```

### API Endpoints Added
- `GET/POST /api/budgets`
- `PUT/DELETE /api/budgets/[id]`
- `GET/POST /api/recurring-expenses`

### Styling Conventions
- **Amber theme** - All dialogs use `bg-white border-2 border-amber-300 text-amber-900`
- **Gradient buttons** - `bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-600 to-orange-600`
- **Consistent dropdowns** - SelectTrigger and SelectContent share styling across all dialogs
