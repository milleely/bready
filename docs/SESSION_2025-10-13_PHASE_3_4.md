# Development Session: October 13, 2025

**Session Focus:** Phase 3 (Enhanced Filtering) + Phase 4 (Receipt Upload System)

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Filtering & Search âœ… COMPLETE

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive expense filtering system with integrated UI directly in the Recent Expenses card. Improved UX by placing filters next to what they control (proximity principle).

### Implementation Summary

#### Part 1: API Enhancement
**Commit:** `3472933` - feat: enhance expense API with advanced filtering (Phase 3 - Part 1)

**Changes:**
- Enhanced `/api/expenses` GET endpoint with 3 new filter parameters:
  - `isShared` - Filter by shared/personal expenses
  - `minAmount` - Minimum amount filter
  - `maxAmount` - Maximum amount filter
- Existing filters: `userId`, `category`, `startDate`, `endDate`

**File Modified:**
- `app/api/expenses/route.ts` (lines 12-48)

---

#### Part 2: Filter UI Integration
**Commit:** `d65c34c` - feat: add comprehensive expense filter panel (Phase 3 - Part 2)

**Changes:**
- Created standalone `ExpenseFilterPanel` component with all 5 filter types
- Added filter state management to `app/page.tsx`
- Filters trigger automatic data refresh via useEffect

**Files:**
- `components/expense-filter-panel.tsx` - NEW (256 lines)
- `app/page.tsx` - Added 5 filter state variables + helper functions

**Features:**
- User dropdown (colored indicators)
- Category dropdown (colored indicators)
- Type selector (all/shared/personal)
- Amount range inputs (min/max)
- Active filter count badge
- "Clear All" button

---

#### Part 3: Filter Restructure (UX Improvement)
**Commit:** `2b00028` - refactor: integrate filters into Recent Expenses card (Phase 3 - Final)

**Rationale:** User feedback identified that filters only affect the expense table, not metrics/charts. Following the proximity principle, filters were moved directly into the Recent Expenses card.

**Changes:**
- Integrated filters into `EnhancedRecentExpenses` component
- Made filters collapsible (show/hide button)
- Removed standalone filter panel
- Updated main page to pass filter props

**Mobile Layout:**
- Filter button with count badge
- Collapsible filter grid (1 column â†’ 2 â†’ 3)
- Full-width inputs on mobile

**Files Modified:**
- `components/enhanced-recent-expenses.tsx` (+202 lines) - Integrated filters
- `app/page.tsx` (-19 lines) - Removed standalone panel
- `components/expense-filter-panel.tsx` (DELETED)

**Benefits:**
âœ… Filters directly next to table they control
âœ… Cleaner dashboard (one less card)
âœ… Better mobile UX (less scrolling)
âœ… Collapsible design saves space

### Bonus Fix: Settlement Card Mobile Overflow
**Commit:** `f4aea68` - fix: settlement card mobile horizontal overflow

**Issue:** Settlement card caused horizontal scrolling on 375px mobile when displaying settlement data due to fixed 3-column grid.

**Solution:**
- Changed from fixed grid to responsive flex layout
- Mobile: Vertical stack (`flex-col`)
- Desktop: 3-column grid (`sm:grid sm:grid-cols-3`)
- Arrow changes direction: down (â†“) on mobile, right (â†’) on desktop
- "Mark as Paid" button full-width on mobile

**File Modified:**
- `components/settlement-card.tsx` (11 lines changed)

**Result:**
âœ… No horizontal scrolling on mobile
âœ… Clean vertical flow on small screens
âœ… Touch-friendly full-width button
âœ… Desktop layout unchanged

## Phase 4: Receipt Upload System ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

### Overview
Adding ability to attach receipt images to expenses for visual tracking and record-keeping.

### Backend Implementation âœ… COMPLETE

#### Part 1: Database Schema
**Commit:** `2c7fdc8` - feat: add receiptUrl field to Expense model (Phase 4 - Part 1)

**Changes:**
- Added `receiptUrl String?` field to Expense model
- Optional field for storing receipt image path/URL
- Prisma client regenerated with updated types

**File Modified:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (line 46)

**Migration:**
- Prisma client generated locally
- Production migration will run on next Vercel deployment

---

#### Part 2: Backend Infrastructure
**Commit:** `3e515e2` - feat: add receipt upload backend infrastructure (Phase 4 - Part 2)

**File Upload API:**
- Created `/api/upload` endpoint
- Validation: JPG, PNG, PDF only (max 5MB)
- Saves to `/public/receipts/` directory
- Returns public URL: `/receipts/filename.ext`
- Requires authentication (household check)

**Expense API Updates:**
- POST `/api/expenses` accepts optional `receiptUrl`
- PUT `/api/expenses/[id]` accepts optional `receiptUrl`
- Both save/update receiptUrl in database

**Storage Setup:**
- `/public/receipts/` directory created
- `.gitignore` excludes uploaded files
- `.gitkeep` tracks directory in git

**Security Features:**
- File type whitelist validation
- File size limits (5MB max)
- Authentication required
- Unique timestamped filenames

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `app/api/upload/route.ts` - NEW (86 lines)
- `app/api/expenses/route.ts` - Added receiptUrl handling
- `app/api/expenses/[id]/route.ts` - Added receiptUrl handling
- `public/receipts/.gitignore` - NEW
- `public/receipts/.gitkeep` - NEW

## Technical Insights

### Filter State Management Pattern
Used controlled component pattern with filter state in parent page. Each filter change triggers useEffect to refetch filtered data from API. Helper functions (`clearAllFilters`, `getActiveFilterCount`) centralize filter logic.

### Proximity Principle in UX
Moved filters from standalone card into Recent Expenses component where they have direct visual impact. Users immediately understand what the filters control, reducing cognitive load.

### Responsive Layout Strategy
Mobile-first approach: Start with `flex flex-col` (vertical), add `sm:grid sm:grid-cols-3` for larger screens. Prevents content squeeze on mobile while preserving elegant desktop layouts.

### File Upload Security
Layered validation: file type whitelist â†’ size check â†’ authentication â†’ unique naming. Decoupled upload endpoint can be reused for other features (avatars, etc.).
